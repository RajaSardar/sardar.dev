      <description>I forgot to tell you something. When I was in middle school, we got our first mobile phone, a Nokia 2626, around 2009-2010. My mobile was GPRS enabled, allowing us to access the internet, although it took about two minutes to load a very basic internet page. The cost was around 1 rupee for 100 KB, and we used to buy a 20 MB pack for 5 rupees, valid for three days, all on 2G data.</description>
