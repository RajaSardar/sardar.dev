      <description>I still have my first bat that I received from my father. I was very less active in outdoor activities. This was largely because my parents often isolated me to help me focus on my future. Whenever I did have some free time, I would go to the paddy fields, climb trees, sit under the shade, and enjoy the greenery, feeling at peace.
In my childhood, like every Bengali, I dreamed of becoming a poet.</description>
