      <description>I forgot to tell you something. When I was in middle school, we got our first mobile phone, a Nokia 2626, around 2009-2010. My mobile was GPRS enabled, allowing us to access the internet, although it took about two minutes to load a very basic internet page. The cost was around 1 rupee for 100 KB, and we used to buy a 20 MB pack for 5 rupees, valid for three days, all on 2G data.</description>

      <description>I still have my first cricket bat that I received from my father. I was very less active in outdoor activities. This was largely because my parents often isolated me to help me focus on my future. Whenever I did have some free time, I would go to the paddy fields, climb trees, sit under the shade, and enjoy the greenery, feeling at peace.
In my childhood, like every Bengali, I dreamed of becoming a poet.</description>
