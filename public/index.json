[{"content":"From my school life, I have been trying to start a blog of my own. Every time I plan to start, my interest fades away. I either start a blog and then forget about it, or I lose motivation. School was completed almost 9-10 years ago, and I left college more than 5 years ago.\nI failed to build HackerLand, failed to establish TheoreX Labs, and faced challenges in jobs. Then, somehow, I survived and moved into the corporate world, where I learned a lot and failed even more. I built some awesome things along the way.\nI transitioned from an introverted student who always wanted to become a mathematician to an entrepreneur who struggled to build a basic product. I then became a developer and eventually moved into DevOps.\nThroughout all these years, I tried a lot but achieved little. But now, I am taking it step by step, finally achieving little by little.\nToday, I am here to document all my thoughts. From today onward, I will write something every day.\nRaja Sardar\nLetâ€™s go from 1 to N.\n","permalink":"https://sardar.dev/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"From my school life, I have been trying to start a blog of my own.
