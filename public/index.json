[{"content":"At least once in our lives, all of us have thought about writing something in the format of a daily diary or a poem or a short story. For older generations, it was obviously a diary where we used to dump everything. However, when we want to share our thoughts with others, there is often a problem.\nFor the new generation, everything is digital; we either write on Facebook or any blog platform. But Facebook was never meant to be a dumping ground for our thoughts; it has become a trash bin filled with garbage. When we want to write something in our own language, it’s not easy for anyone to find a suitable platform, except for a few. Most platforms are either built for English speakers or cater to global languages.\nLet’s build a platform for everyone to write whatever they want from all over India, without any language barriers and without worrying about money.\nWe all have something to write, something to share with everyone, and we want to document our daily activities. It will be your space. You can use it as a note taking platform, to write your thoughts, or even to publish a book.\nI am naming the project as Likhoo, and I will start building this platform step by step. I will also verify my own binary theory for habit building.\nMy binary theory states that when you start something (e.g., a new habit), you should break it into very small targets and begin with the smallest first target. You may fail to achieve it, but that’s fine; you will have a grace period, meaning there are no strict rules to follow. You can miss targets and deadlines; the only rule to follow is to maintain continuity, at least do something consistently, even if it’s just 5 minutes a day. That’s still okay under this rule.\nFrom now on, until we achieve this task, I will follow this syntax to maintain our progress:\nProject Likhoo Day 1 : L1.\n","permalink":"https://sardar.dev/posts/l0-lets-start-a-startup-from-ground-zero/","summary":"At least once in our lives, all of us have thought about writing something in the format of a daily diary or a poem or a short story.

Many others likely felt the same, all trying to stay innovative and productive in an environment that lacked those elements.\nFrom this simple idea, we started HackerLand with the motto of creating a community for designers, innovators, and programmers all in one place. A community where you would always feel productive and innovative. We began with just 2-3 friends and then expanded to a larger team. We were planning, designing, and executing various Ideas. We launched our first website, which was just a static page.\nAt this time, I discovered that executing ideas is far more complicated and frustrating than coming up with them. It requires good leadership skills, effective communication, sufficient resources to operate without worry, a strong team that aligns with your vision, and, most importantly, a hardworking mindset. I once heard a phrase that says, You will get as much as you put in; if you work to achieve 10, you will never get 11; you will always get below 10. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as that.\nWe built a great team, worked on exciting idea, and learned a lot - from team building and product marketing to creating a culture where everyone aligns with the same dream and lots more.\nThe beautiful child used to look like below HackerLand. As of now, I have come to understand that patience and perseverance are the keys to success.\nDue to a lack of financial support, we decided to hibernate our dream project for now, promising to come back stronger.\n","permalink":"https://sardar.dev/posts/why-and-how-i-started-hackerland/","summary":"During a long weekend at home, I felt that I was missing something very important in my life: a productive environment and a community that I had in college.

I have always dreamed of building something of my own and making an impact on society from the very beginning of my life. One thing I knew for sure was that whatever I learned or studied, I would surely build my career in Internet and Software Technology.\nI wrote my very first business plan during my first year of college and participated in the Business Plan competition at IIT Kharagpur\u0026rsquo;s annual tech fest, but I was rejected. However, I learned an important lesson: never get demotivated by rejections and failures. You should be thankful and motivated by the fact that at least you tried.

The first few days were filled with the fear of ragging from our beloved seniors. We had a very negative view of ragging, but eventually, we began to understand that those seniors were becoming our guardians and friends. What we believed to be ragging was actually what we needed in real life: the ability to communicate, step out of our comfort zones, and develop other essential skills.\nIn college, what we call ragging is similar to what we face in job interviews.\nWe formed a gang of innovation seekers, sitting together to discuss new ideas and concepts. Brainstorming became our regular activity, and we had our own unique methods for generating ideas.\nNabarun, Sayan, Tanuj, Sudhakar, and few others, we considered brainstorming our daily routine; it was like caffeine for us. Especially Tanuj and I, we would start our discussions after dinner, and those conversations sometimes continued until 4 AM, 6 AM, or even 7 AM the next day. This was not just a one time occurrence; it became our regular routine. Our roommates often became frustrated with our late night discussions.\nWe subscribed to a nearby science center and enrolled in innovation center. We also secured funding for our project, which was a drone. We built most of the body parts using 3D printing, except for the electronic components.\nAlthough it was a semi successful project, we were unable to fly the drone due to the parts we had created ourselves with the 3D printer.

Maybe this was my destiny. Perhaps my chemistry teacher was right about me, and maybe I would not be able to achieve anything in my life. All my dreams started fading. But engineering college was my way out from my darkest time, and it was like a dream come true.\nAfter getting into college, I started building things, connecting with the community, and making lots of good friends. The first thing I did was build a website for the college community called uitian.in. Then I built my first dream project startup blog named bloomble.com. I was building the website when YourStory was just starting.\nWe participated in multiple college tech fests and also owned a robotics competition.\nI connected with one of my seniors and started contributing to her startup, which she had started in her final year.\nWe formed multiple clubs in college and started participating in multiple events.\nIt was a damn productive year for me. I was so satisfied. It\u0026rsquo;s not like we only did activities; I was having fun too. Every afternoon, we used to go for cold coffee, momos, and litti chokha, and when we went, we went as a team. The taste of those still brings a smile to my face.\nOur daily routine was to either go out for these foods or bring chop and muri, and all six of our roommates would eat together in the evening.\nI used to learn and build thing, watch movies or web series until morning, and all my friends from the hostel used to come to our room to gossip and discuss productive stuff. Everyone knew that the only person they could be sure would be awake and in front of his desktop was me.\nIf you were in my college hostel (Banabas), you would not be able to tell if it was midnight or evening, as almost everyone was awake. Some were playing something on the ground, some were discussing, and some were reading books.\nAt midnight, we used to go out through the broken window of the hostel and then flee over the gate of the ground so that we could drink chai.\nIt was an amazing year for all of us.

I struggled with my studies so much that my teacher said if I could crack the engineering entrance exam, he would stop teaching and leave the center. One of my friends from near my home, named Manideepa, was the most talented student of all.\nInitially, I thought my teacher was ignoring me because I was from a rural area, but then I realized that Manideepa was also from my area. Perhaps the teacher knew how to provoke someone into achieving something they didn\u0026rsquo;t believe they could do themselves.\nA year later, when I qualified for engineering, all my friends urged me to confront him about his earlier comments. However, that day I understood why he said what he did, and I will always be thankful for his guidance.\nI took a gap year in my 12th grade, during which I worked at my father\u0026rsquo;s cycle repair shop from 7 AM to 9 or 11 PM. Although I was familiar with the work, the thought that consumed me every second was that I would do anything else but this. I needed to escape; I had many dreams to fulfill. That year was one of the darkest periods of my life. Everyone, from outsiders to teachers, treated me like a failure. But once I moved into engineering, I felt like I had a new lease on life.\nLater, I found that many of my friends were still struggling with decision making about their futures, while I at least knew what I wanted from my life.\nLife isn\u0026rsquo;t very difficult if we maintain a routine and follow it over the long term. We need self confidence, believing that whatever the world says may be true from their perspective, but I know myself and what I am capable of. I will always believe in myself. This belief is crucial. There is a phrase: \u0026ldquo;Repeat a lie often enough, and it becomes the truth.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, don’t let negative words affect you. However, be judgmental; assess what others are saying, as sometimes nature tries to convey something important to you.\nWhen I entered my engineering college, I was the shyest and most tech savvy boy in my class.

When I was in middle school, we got our first mobile phone, a Nokia 2626, around 2009-2010. My mobile was GPRS enabled, allowing us to access the internet, although it took about two minutes to load a very basic internet page. The cost was around 1 rupee for 100 KB, and we used to buy a 20 MB pack for 5 rupees, valid for three days, all on 2G data. That\u0026rsquo;s when I started my internet journey. I downloaded Opera Mini and UC Browser, began exploring the internet, created a Gmail account, and signed up for Facebook. I felt like I knew a lot about the internet.\nI used to lecture everyone in my school about technology, especially about the internet. My friends Goutam, Salman, and I would call, message, and discuss everything about Gmail, social media, how to download songs, and where to find \u0026ldquo;Sunday Suspense\u0026rdquo; and soo on. One day, in my 10th grade, Salman told me he had built his own website. That single sentence changed my life. That day, I searched for how to build a website from my mobile and found a few resources, including wapka.mobi. I created an account and started exploring how to have my own website. That night, I created my very first website, which was something like rajasardar.wapka.mobi.\nFrom there, I searched Google for how to make text bold, how to add color, how to animate it, how to italicize text, and what a link is, all through Google searches. Over the next two years, I built multiple websites using wapka.mobi\u0026rsquo;s inbuilt builder and a few codes, one of which was greenmusic.wapka.mobi, a fully functional website. Then, I started thinking about how to build a desktop website and began learning about domain names, web hosting, coding languages, servers, and more.\nI had a diary inherited from a fraud caught by my uncle a few years ago, where I started writing my thoughts from 10th grade. From that time, I dreamed of a dystopian digital education system and noted down how it should be, which led me to think about what else we could do with these technologies. I began dreaming up many ideas and noted them down in that diary and a few more notebooks. I researched domain names and checked on GoDaddy.com to see if they were available.\nWhen I was in 11th grade, all these internet and e-commerce companies started booming. The very first domain I bought from GoDaddy was priceraj.com, so I could create a website for comparing prices of products from different websites.\nThroughout this journey, I always thought I would pursue a degree in Mathematics, as it was my lifelong dream. However, due to personal reasons, I dropped out of my higher secondary final exam (12th grade). After that, my father bought me a guitar and a desktop computer in 2013-2014. I built priceraj.com as a fully functional price comparison website, but only the front end without any backend logic. I identified gaps in how to make it functional, how to implement logic, and how to make it user ready, which led me to learn more about computers and the internet.\nI started taking programming tuition in C language from a local computer teacher.

I would sit alone, contemplating nature and giving it a rhythm. I will never forget those feelings; they brought me eternal peace. I remember being \u0026ldquo;alone in the middle of a green field, with the sweet breeze blowing, while cows grazed nearby.

I never enjoyed reading books, so my teacher, Koto Pisi, would hit me with a stick every day. After my mother, she was my first teacher, and I owe much of who I am today to her influence.\nIn school, I was often isolated.

I would shout and debate, doing whatever it took to grab his attention.\nI had a few of the best teachers in my life: Durga Sir, Soumitra Sir, and Sujan Sir.

He always aimed to make me the best, He is Suman Sir.\nToday, I miss those school days, my friends, and the moments we shared during class breaks, especially hanging out with Soumitra Sir in the sports room after school.\nI also cherish the lifelong friendships I formed with Salman, Goutam, Gopal, Indra, and many others.\nAnd then there was her, I never missed classes without a reason because I was captivated by her beauty and charm.\nMy school did not have a science stream, so I had to switch to another school for my 11th grade. I left my school and moved to one that only had classes 11 and 12. It was one of the few schools like that in all of India.\nLike the unique nature of this school, the students were also distinctive. Many were the children of drug dealers and criminals.\nWe would attend tuition in the morning, then head to school, as our school mandated that we attend all eight classes in a day.
