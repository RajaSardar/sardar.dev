From my school life, i was trying to start a blog of my own, everytime when i plan to start, my interest on that goes away. Or I start a blog and then forget about it, School has been compleated almost 9-10 years ago, left collage more than 5 years ago.

Faild to build HackerLand, faild to build TheoreX Labs, failed in Jobs, Then somehow survibed and moved into the corporate majdoor world, learnt a lot, faild a lot. Build some awsome things.

Moved from an introvert student who always wanted to become a Mathametician to an Enterprenuar who failed to build a basic product.

Then become a dev and again moved into DevOps.

In all this years, i tried a lot but achive a little.
But now i am trying dot by dot.
Finally achiving little by little.

Today i am here to document all my thoughts. From today i will write something everyday.
