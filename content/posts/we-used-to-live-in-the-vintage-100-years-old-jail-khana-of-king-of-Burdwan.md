Upon arriving at college, I encountered people from outside my state who didn't know Bengali, and I didn't know much Hindi. We stayed in a hostel room with six students, located in a vintage building that used to be a jail of the King of Burdwan. I have seen vintage Kaman in between the jungle area of hostel, also there was some old locked rooms, which used to be the nachghor (dance hall) of king. And also heard that from the building to the main house of the king there still used to have a undergroud tunnel, which has been locked from both side. 


This is the main entrance of the hostel.
