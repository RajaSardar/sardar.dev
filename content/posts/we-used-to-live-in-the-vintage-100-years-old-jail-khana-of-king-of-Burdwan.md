Upon arriving at college, I encountered people from outside my state who didn't know Bengali, and I didn't know much Hindi. We stayed in a hostel room with six students, located in a vintage building that used to be a jail of the King of Burdwan. 

I saw a vintage Kaman in the jungle area of the hostel, and there were also some old locked rooms that used to be the nachghor (dance hall) of the king. Additionally, I heard that there used to be an underground tunnel connecting the building to the main house of the king, which has been locked from both sides.


This is the main entrance of the hostel.
