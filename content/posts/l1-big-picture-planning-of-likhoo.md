# Likhoo 
### Build a big picture plan for what we will build in points 
1. Find a domain name suitable for the project.
2. List out features.
3. Draw a design for the expected UI.
4. Convert the design into static pages.
5. Setup Database.
6. Convert the static pages into the final product.
7. Publish and start promoting.
8. Start working on converting it for other languages.


## Let's Now Break Down Each Step:: 
### 1. Find a Domain Name Suitable for the Project:

As we are building a platform for writers, the domain name should be related to that concept. I thought of a few famous domains in this space: 
1. WordPress
2. Wattpad
3. Medium
4. Hashnode
5. Pratilipi 

A few related words include: 
1. Wordpad 
2. Notepad 
3. Textpress
4. Likhoo
5. Writerr
6. Readerr

What I think is that the name we choose should:

1. Be related to the idea. 
2. Be a very simple word.
3. Be a well-known word.
4. Ideally have double letters in it.
5. Be easy to pronounce.

Since I am building a platform for Indians, I am looking for a word that most Indians know and use every day.


I believe "Likhoo" meets all these criteria. I checked for domain availability, and [likhoo.in](likhoo.in) is available. Therefore, I will take Likhoo as the primary domain for the project. And I did this research before writing all this here so, I already put Likhoo everywhere. 


So, one is done, and seven more to go!
