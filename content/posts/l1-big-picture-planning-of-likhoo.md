# Likhoo 
### Build a big picture plan for what we will build in points 
1. Find a domain name suteable for the project.
2. List out features.
3. Draw a design for the expected UI.
4. Convert the design into static pages.
5. Setup Database.
6. Convert the static pages into final product.
7. Publish and start promoting.
8. Start working on converting for other language.


## Lets now break down each steps: 
### 1. Find a domain name suteable for the project:

As we are building a platform for writer, the domain na,e should be related to that words only, I thought for few famous domains exist in this domain : 
1. wordpress
2. wattpad
3. medium
4. hashnode
5. pratilipi 

and few related words are : 
1. wordpad 
2. nodepad 
3. textpress
4. likhoo
5. writerr
6. readerr

What i think is the name that we will put
1. Should be related to the idea. 
2. Have to be very simple word.
3. Very well known word.
4. Best to have doubble letters in it.
5. Very easy to pronauns. 

As i am building a platform for the Indian's, I am looking for a word which most indian's know and use every day.


I think `Likhoo` is matching all the criteria here, and i looked for the domain if it is available, [likhoo.in](likhoo.in) is available, So, I will take likhoo as primary domain for the project.


So one is done 7 more to go
