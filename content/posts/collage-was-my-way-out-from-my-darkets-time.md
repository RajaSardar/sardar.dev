In my drop year in my class 12, In spite of beeing one of the strongest self beleaver, I almost started thinking that all my dreams are going to die. May be this is the destiny of mine. maybe my chemistory teacher was right about me, maybe i will not be able to achive anything in my life. All my dreams started fading. But engineering collage was my way out from my darkets time and it was like my dream come true.

After getting into collage, I started building things, connecting with the community, build lots of good frends, 
First thing i did was built a website for the collage community called uitian.in, Then build my first dream project startup blogs named - bloomble.com, I was building the website when yourstory was just starting. 

We perticipate in multiple collage techfest and also own a robotics competision.

I connected with one of my senior and started contribiuting in her startup, which she has started in her final year. 
We formed multiple clubs in collage and started perticipating in multiple events.

It was damn productive year for me. I was so much satisfied. It is not like we only was doing activity. I was having fun too, Everyday afternoon we used to go for cold coffee, momos and litti chokha, and when we goes we goes in a team. The test of thoese still curve my mouth. 

Our daily routine was to either go out for these foods or we used to bring chop and muri and all our room mates, 6 of them, we all eat together in the evening. 

I used to learn and build something or watching some movie or webseries till morning, And all my frinds from hostel used to come to our room, to gossipe and discussing productive stuff, who are awake till mid night, everyone knows that the only person they can gurrenty that, he will surly be awake and in fron of his desktop is me.

If you were in my collage hostel (Banabas), You will not be able to understand if it is midnight or evening, almost all are awake, some are playing something in ground, some are discussing, some are reading books.

At mid night, we used to go out by the broken window of hostel and then fleed over the gate of the ground so that we can dinkg Chai. 

It was amezing year for all of us, we lived our fullest in that year. It is still my best time of my life.
