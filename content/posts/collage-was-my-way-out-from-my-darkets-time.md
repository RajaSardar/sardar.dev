In my drop year in class 12, despite being one of the strongest believers in myself, I almost started thinking that all my dreams were going to die. Maybe this was my destiny. Perhaps my chemistry teacher was right about me, and maybe I would not be able to achieve anything in my life. All my dreams started fading. But engineering college was my way out from my darkest time, and it was like a dream come true.

After getting into college, I started building things, connecting with the community, and making lots of good friends. The first thing I did was build a website for the college community called uitian.in. Then I built my first dream project startup blog named bloomble.com. I was building the website when YourStory was just starting.

We participated in multiple college tech fests and also owned a robotics competition.

I connected with one of my seniors and started contributing to her startup, which she had started in her final year. 

We formed multiple clubs in college and started participating in multiple events.

It was a damn productive year for me. I was so satisfied. It's not like we only did activities; I was having fun too. Every afternoon, we used to go for cold coffee, momos, and litti chokha, and when we went, we went as a team. The taste of those still brings a smile to my face.

Our daily routine was to either go out for these foods or bring chop and muri, and all six of our roommates would eat together in the evening.

I used to learn and build thing, watch movies or web series until morning, and all my friends from the hostel used to come to our room to gossip and discuss productive stuff. Everyone knew that the only person they could be sure would be awake and in front of his desktop was me.

If you were in my college hostel (Banabas), you would not be able to tell if it was midnight or evening, as almost everyone was awake. Some were playing something on the ground, some were discussing, and some were reading books.

At midnight, we used to go out through the broken window of the hostel and then flee over the gate of the ground so that we could drink chai.

It was an amazing year for all of us. We lived our fullest in that year. It is still the best time of my life.
