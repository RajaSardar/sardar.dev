After an awesome first year, we moved to a new hostel located inside the college campus. The first few days were filled with the fear of ragging from our beloved seniors. We had a very negative view of ragging, but eventually, we began to understand that those seniors were becoming our guardians and friends. What we believed to be ragging was actually what we needed in real life: the ability to communicate, step out of our comfort zones, and develop other essential skills.

In college, what we call ragging is similar to what we face in job interviews.

We formed a gang of innovation seekers, sitting together to discuss new ideas and concepts. Brainstorming became our regular activity, and we had our own unique methods for generating ideas.

Nabarun, Sayan, Tanuj, Sudhakar, and few others, we considered brainstorming our daily routine; it was like caffeine for us. Especially Tanuj and I, we would start our discussions after dinner, and those conversations sometimes continued until 4 AM, 6 AM, or even 7 AM the next day. This was not just a one time occurrence; it became our regular routine. Our roommates often became frustrated with our late night discussions.

We subscribed to a nearby science center and enrolled in innovation center. We also secured funding for our project, which was a drone. We built most of the body parts using 3D printing, except for the electronic components.

Although it was a semi successful project, we were unable to fly the drone due to the parts we had created ourselves with the 3D printer. Since it was a long term project, we never found the time to fix it before leaving.
