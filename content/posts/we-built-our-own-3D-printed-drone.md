After the most awsome first year, We moved to new hostel which was inside collage campus. First few days was filled with fear of ragging by our beloved seniors. We had a very bad view about ragging, but eventually started understanding that, those seniors are becoming our gurdians and frends, And what is bealived to be ragging is what we need in our real life, The ability to communicate, come out of our comfort zone and other stuff....

In collage what we call ragging that in life we call job interview. 

We used to have a gang of innovation seekers, we sit together and discuss abut new things and ideas. We used to do brain storming together. We had our own way to find ideas. 

Nabarun, Sayan, Tanuj, Sudhakar and others for us brain storming was our reguler activity and it was like caffine for us. Specially me and Tanuj we used to start our discussions after dinner and that disscussions coontinues till the next day morning 4am sometime 6am and even 7am. And it was not like, by any chance it happened for one day, It was our reguler routine. Our roommates used to become fustrated by our diccusstions. 

We took supscription to nearby science center and enrolled to innovation center. Also got fund for our project which was a drone. We built most of the body parts with 3d printing except the electronics parts. 

Although it was a semi successfull project as we were not able to fly it because of the parts that we build by our own using 3d printer. As it was a very long project, we never got time to fix it before leaving.
