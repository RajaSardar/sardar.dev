At least once in our lives, all of us have thought about writing something in the format of a daily diary or a poem or a short story. For older generations, it was obviously a diary where we used to dump everything. However, when we want to share our thoughts with others, there is often a problem.

For the new generation, everything is digital; we either write on Facebook or any blog platform. But Facebook was never meant to be a dumping ground for our thoughts; it has become a trash bin filled with garbage. When we want to write something in our own language, it’s not easy for anyone to find a suitable platform, except for a few. Most platforms are either built for English speakers or cater to global languages.

Let’s build a platform for everyone to write whatever they want from all over India, without any language barriers and without worrying about money.

We all have something to write, something to share with everyone, and we want to document our daily activities. It will be your space. You can use it as a note taking platform, to write your thoughts, or even to publish a book.

I am naming the project as Likhoo, and I will start building this platform step by step. I will also verify my own binary theory for habit building.

My binary theory states that when you start something (e.g., a new habit), you should break it into very small targets and begin with the smallest first target. You may fail to achieve it, but that’s fine; you will have a grace period, meaning there are no strict rules to follow. You can miss targets and deadlines; the only rule to follow is to maintain continuity, at least do something consistently, even if it’s just 5 minutes a day. That’s still okay under this rule.

From now on, until we achieve this task, I will follow this syntax to maintain our progress: 

Project `L`ikhoo Day `1` : `L1`.
