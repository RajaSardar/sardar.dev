I used to go for chemistory tution 30-40kms far from home at Sonarpur, in city. I was so bad at study that, he said if i can crack engineering entrance, he will stop teaching and leve the center, Although one of my friend from near my home, named Manideepa used to be the most talented student of all. 
Firstly i was thinking like it is because i am from rural area, so he is ignoring or treating us like this, then found no, Manideepa is also from my area, maybe teacher knows how to provoke someone to do and achinve something that they are not bealiving in by themselvs.

One year after when i got qualified for Engineering, all my friends asked me to told and take revange of him, what he has told me earlier, but that day i realize why he said and what he said, 
I will always be thankfull of what he has done.

Although i took a gap of 1 year at my 12th. In that year i used to work at my father's Cycle Reparing shop from morning 7-8 till night 9-11. Although i know all the stuff, but the one thing that used to come to my mind every second is, i will do anything else but this....
I have to get out of this.. I have lot of dreams to fullfil, that one year was one of the darkest year of my life. From outsider to teacher everyone treat me like i am a failour. But when i moved to engineering i got a new life. 
Latter found many of my friends are still stuck with deacission making, waht they wants to do in life, and what they are doing, at least i know what i know want from my life.

Life isn't very deficult if we maintain a routine and follow that for long term.
And need self-confidance in ourself that whatever the world is saying may be they are right from thair side, but I know myself, I know what i am capeble of, I will always beleve in myself. It is very myuch important. There is a phreas that `Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth`.
So don't let the negetive words to come in you. But be judgemental, judge what they are saying, sometime nature try to say something to you. 

When i moved to my engineering collage, I used to be the most shy and teche boy.
I was the only boy in the entire class to have a desktop in hostel, used to carry that every week or every two week to home and then back to collage hostel which was aroud 150 Kms far. 

When i reach collage, first time in my life saw someone outside of my state and who does not know Bengali and also i don't know much Hindi, We used to stay in a hostel room where we were 6 students in a room, that was a vintage building used to be the Jail of the King of Burdwan.
