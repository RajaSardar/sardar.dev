Today is a historic day for Bangladesh as they has toppeled the current gov and successfully army coup, which started as a student protest.
For some this is another Indipendence for them and for other it is anther chance to loot and torture minorities.


Okay, lets come to my story, I had dream to build something of my own and make an impact to the socity from the very begining of my life. One thing that i knew that, whatever i lear or study, I will build my own carrier in Internet and Software Technology.

So i wrote my very first business plan in my first year of my collage and perticipate in Bussiness Plan competition of IIT Kharagpur annual techfest, but I got rejected. 
But one thing that i got that never get demotivated by rejections and failours.
You should be thankful and motivated by thinking that atlest you tried, Improve yourself. 

Latter i started multiple things as a product to do business through innovations and solutions but failed missurabily.

Tomorrow i will tell you about my few more failour stories.
