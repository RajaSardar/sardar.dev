Today is a historic day for Bangladesh as they have toppled the current government through a successful army coup that began as a student protest. For some, this marks another independence, while for others, it presents another opportunity to loot and oppress minorities.

Now, lets back to my story. I have always dreamed of building something of my own and making an impact on society from the very beginning of my life. One thing I knew for sure was that whatever I learned or studied, I would surely build my career in Internet and Software Technology.

I wrote my very first business plan during my first year of college and participated in the Business Plan competition at IIT Kharagpur's annual tech fest, but I was rejected. However, I learned an important lesson: never get demotivated by rejections and failures. You should be thankful and motivated by the fact that at least you tried. Focus on improving yourself.

Later, I started multiple projects as products to do business through innovations and solutions, but I failed miserably.

Tomorrow, I will share more of my failure stories.
