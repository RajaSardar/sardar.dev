During a long weekend at home, I felt that I was missing something very important in my life: a productive environment and a community that I had in college. Many others likely felt the same, all trying to stay innovative and productive in an environment that lacked those elements.

From this simple idea, we started HackerLand with the motto of creating a community for designers, innovators, and programmers all in one place. A community where you would always feel productive and innovative.
We began with just 2-3 friends and then expanded to a larger team. We were planning, designing, and executing various Ideas. We launched our first website, which was just a static page.

At this time, I discovered that executing ideas is far more complicated and frustrating than coming up with them. It requires good leadership skills, effective communication, sufficient resources to operate without worry, a strong team that aligns with your vision, and, most importantly, a hardworking mindset.
I once heard a phrase that says, *`You will get as much as you put in; if you work to achieve 10, you will never get 11; you will always get below 10.`* It's as simple as that.

We built a great team, worked on exciting idea, and learned a lot - from team building and product marketing to creating a culture where everyone aligns with the same dream and lots more.

As of now, I have come to understand that *`patience and perseverance are the keys to success`*.

Due to a lack of financial support, we decided to hibernate our dream project for now, promising to come back stronger.
