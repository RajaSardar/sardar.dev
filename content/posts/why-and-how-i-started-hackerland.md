I was in a long weekend in my home and i feel that i am missing something very important of my life. A productive environment, a community that i used to have in my collage. Like me lots of others will be here who feels the same, all trying to stay innovative and productive in an environment where they are not having any of those. 

From this simple idea we started HackerLand with a moto to make a community for Designers, Innovators & Programmers at One Place. A community where you will always feel pproductive and innovative. 

We started with 2-3 of friends only then expanded to a large team. We were planning, designing and executing things. 
We launched our first website with only static page. 

At this time i found out that excuting Ideas are far more complecated and fustrateting than finding Ideas. 

It needs good leadership skills, good communication skills, enough assets to run without worry, a very good team who alignes with your dream, and the most important is hard working mindset.

I have heard one phresh that says `You will get how much you put efforts, if you work for getting 10 you will never get 11, you will always get below 10` Its as simple as that. 

We built a great team, was working on a great Idea, learnt a lot of things - "From team building, product marketing to creating a culture where all will align to the same dream"

And as of now, what else i have understood that, `patience and perseverance are the key to success`

Because of lack of financial support we decide to hibernate our dream child for now. And prommised to come back stronger.
