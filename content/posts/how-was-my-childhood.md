I still have my first bat that i got from my fathar, I was that much active in the outdoor activity that i was never able to play anything, that because of my parents always put me in isolation, so that i can focus on my feature, and also if i ever get some time i used to go into paddy field, cliemb tree, sit under the tree and enjoy greenary, feel the peace.

In my chieldhood, as every single bengali, i like to become a poet, I used to sit alone and think about the nature and gives it a rytham. I will never forget about that feelings ever, that had the eternal peace for me - "Alone in the meiddle of green field, and the sweet wind breezaring, not so far away cows are busy with eating grasses or Sitting the the open sky on a fullmoon night and enjoying the beauty of the God how beautifully he has made the galaxy with lots of glittering stars and the most beautifull moon"

I still remember those days when electricity used to cut for more than the whole night at summer and we used to go out and lay on the street on a mat, the street area used to be the end of our village and after that you will only see paddy field, And there you will ge the most switest wind of your entire life. 

My daily life was like weak up early in the morning by mom's or dad's calling, after weaking up me and my sister used to do marathon of brush, so that who will come first, he/she will get the bigger amount of snacks that dad bring last night for us. 

Then go for tution and I was the most laziest person of all, and i never liked reading books so my teacher `Koto Pisi` used to bit me everyday with stick, after my mother she was my first teacher and today i think what i am today, she has a big impact on that.

In school also I used to be the most isolated guy, I still remeber my roll number in class 1 was 23 and then become 1st in the class but still i was the boy who used to get biitten by the teacher the most because my spelling mistake, that you can also see today !!!

High school was the most beautifull time till now, I secure 8-9th in high school entrance and from there to securing 2nd in the whole class. You will not find me in class as i will hide behind all. But if it is Mathamatic, if you were in my class you will feel like i am the only student to whome teacher is teaching, I will shought, I will debate. I will do whatever i need to grab his attention. 

I got few best teacher of my life three math teachers Durga sir, Soumitra Sir and Sujan sir.
And the gurdian without him I would have never be able to become what i am today, he was the terror of the whole school, was my mentor, my tution teacher, my school teacher, my gurdian after parents. He always wanted to made me the best. 

Today i miss those school days, those friends, those hangout in class break, hangout with Soumitra sir in spoorts room after school.

And lots of lifelong friends, Salman, Goutam, Gopal, Indra and sooooooo onnnnnnnnnn........ 

And she, i never missed classes without any reasone, because i was drugged by her beauty and cuteness.

My school does not had science stream so i had to switch school in my 11th. So i left my school and moved to an another school which had only 2 class in that entire school (class 11 and class 12), It is one of the few school like that in the entire India. 
Like the unique in neature of this school, the students were also unique in nature, lots of sons of drug diller to criminal, they were in this school. 

We use to go tution in the morning then from tution to school as our shool made mendatory of doing all 8 classes in a day, then after finishing the school we have to go for another tution that was 40-50 km far from home, we used to reach home at night 10-11 sometime.
