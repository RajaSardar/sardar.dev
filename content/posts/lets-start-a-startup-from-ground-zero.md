All of us in our lifetime at lest once though to write something in a format of daily diary or some poem. For all old generation it is oviously the diary, where we used to dump everything. but when we want to share it with other there is problem.

For new generation, it's all digital, either we write it on facebook or any blog platform. but facebook was never ment to dump those things, It has become a dust bin, you will find all the gurbage there. And when you want ton write something in your language its never that much easy for anyone to write in any platfom except few. Because almost all of them never focused for Indian's. It was either build for english speaking peoples or for the global languages.

Let's build a platform for everyone to write whatever they want from all over India, without any language barier, without waring about mony.

All of us have something to write, something to tell everyone, want to write about our daily activity.
It will be your space. You can do whatever you want here, You can use it as a note taking platform to writing your toughts to publish a book.

Naming the project as Likhoo, I will start in step by steps to build this platform. And also i will verify my own binary theory for habit building.

My binary theory says you start something (ex: new habit), break it into very small tergets and start with very small first terget, you can fail to achive but its fine, you will get gress period, which means no strict rules to follow, you can miss terget, deadline, only one rules to follow is just maintain the continuty, at least do something continusly, it can be 5 mins in a day, still its okay in this rule.    

From now on untill we achive this task i will follow this syntax to maintail where we are
Project `L`ikhoo Day `1` : `L1`
