I forgot to tell you guys something, When i was in middle school, at that time we got our first mobile phone which is Nokia 2626, which is around 2009-2010, and my mobile was a gprs enabled mobile, so we can access internet one very basic mobile screen would have took 2 min to load and the price was around 1rupee/100kb and we used to have 20mb pack in 5rs for 3 days and all this was 2g data from there i start my internet journey, I downloaded Opera mini and UC Browser and started exploring internet, created gmail account and facebook account, And i was feeling like i know a lot about internet.

Used to be the guy who lecture everyone in my school about technology, specially about internet. Me, Goutam and Salman used to call, message and discuss about everything about what is gmail, what is social media and how to download songs, where to find sunday suspence and all these stuff. One day in my class 10th Salman told me that he he had built his own website, that single sentence changed my entire life, that day i srearch how to build website from mobile and found few websites wapka.mobi was one of them, I started creating account and exploring how to have my own website, That night, 

I created my very first website, which was something like `rajasardar.wapka.mobi`. From there i search google how to made a text bold, how to make it colourful, how to animate it, how to tilt the text (italic), what is a link, all these by searching google. Then next 2 years i built multiple website from wapka.mobi using it's inbuilt builder ans few of codes, one of them is greenmusic.wapka.mobi (fully functional website). Then one day i started thinking how to build a desktop website and started searching, learnt about Domain names, Web Hosting, Coding Languages, Servers and all these. 

I used to have a diary inherited from a fraud, caught by my uncle few years ago, i started writing my taughts from my class 10th. From that time i dreamed of a distopian digital education system, and note down how it should be, that leads me to think what else we can do using these technologies. I started dreaming about lots of ideas and noted down all thoese in that diary and few more notebooks. I started researching about domain names and searching on Godaddy.com if it is available or not.

When i was in class 11th all these Internet company just started booming. The very first domain that i baught from godaddy was priceraj.com, so that i can make a website for price comparing all product from different website.

In between all this i always thought that i will do graduation in Mathamatics as it is my lifelong dream. But because of some personal reason i droped my higher secondary final exam (12th). After that my father baught me a guiter and a desktop computer in the year 2013-2014. And i built priceraj.com as a fully functional price compare website, but only the frontend part without any backend logic, and found gaps that how to make it functional, how to put logics in it, how to made it user ready, that leads me to start learing more into computer and internet.

I started taking C language programming tution from a local computer teacher. Knowing that although i will become a mathametician, i still will build something using technology, which will impact the socity. I bought few more domains.
